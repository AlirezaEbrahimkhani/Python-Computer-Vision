Explanation :

Background subtraction (BS) is a common and widely used technique for generating a foreground mask
(namely, a binary image containing the pixels belonging to moving objects in the scene) by using 
static cameras.

Background modeling consists of two main steps:

1. Background Initialization;
2. Background Update.

In the first step, an initial model of the background is computed, while in the second step that model
is updated in order to adapt to possible changes in the scene.
